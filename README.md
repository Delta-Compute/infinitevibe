# TensorFlix - Decentralized AI Video Production

A blockchain-coordinated system where miners create video content and validators score them based on their popular appeal.

## Overview

TensorFlix implements a decentralized content creation and validation pipeline:
- **Miners** submit video content to the SN and post the content on social media, and eventually the TensorFlix website
- **Validator**  score submissions by their engagement on the video traffic. Validators also: verify content is 100% AI generated, zero illicit content, traffic is real/not bots. 
- **Coordination** happens through Bittensor blockchain and GitHub gists
