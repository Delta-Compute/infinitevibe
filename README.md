# TensorFlix - Media Production and Streaming

Bittensor based AI Film studio, where creators (miners) are incentivized to invest in technologies and push the creative limits of AI video and film production. Validators act as producers, ensuring that output quality progressively improves to the highest of levels of traditional studios. As a way to grow awareness and attract the attention of the worlds best creatives, miners will initially be graded based on their work's engagement on social media. The content will be reposted on https://tensorflix.ai/ - eventually scoring will migrate to tensorflix.ai and will be based on more refined metrics than simply views/likes. 
Validators in the network will receive reveneus from tensorflix.ai site based on their stakeweight - incentivizing traditional "Hollywood" producers to enter Bittensor to scout and produce new content. 
Miner collateral will be an important component. to Disincentivize cheating but also to be used to fund future projects, with greater technology needs. 
Freedom of expression and content genre and form are largely open to the miners creative direction, especially at the project startup. Eventually we expect to see Miners progress from clips or "reels" to short films, mini-series.  


## Overview

TensorFlix implements a decentralized content creation and validation pipeline:
- **Miners** submit video content to the SN and post the content on social media, and eventually the TensorFlix website
- **Validator**  score submissions by their engagement on the video traffic. Validators also: verify content is 100% AI generated, zero illicit content, traffic is real/not bots. 
- **Coordination** happens through Bittensor blockchain and GitHub gists
