# InfiniteVibe Brief System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the two-track mining system as outlined in the team plan. The system now supports both traditional social media submissions and custom brief-based video creation.

## ✅ Completed Features (Week 1 & 2)

### 1. Database Schema & Models
- **Brief Model**: Complete lifecycle management with automatic deadline calculation
- **BriefSubmission Model**: Tracks miner submissions with validation and scoring
- **Database Operations**: Full CRUD operations with optimized indexing
- **ID Generation**: Unique brief and submission ID systems

### 2. Protocol Integration
- **Commit Parsing**: Automatically detects brief format (`{briefId}:sub_1:{r2_link}`) vs traditional gists
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing gist submissions continue to work unchanged
- **Validation**: Enforces brief deadlines and top 10 submission permissions

### 3. Validator Integration
- **Brief Processing**: Complete pipeline for validating and storing brief submissions
- **R2 Storage Validation**: Video file validation, metadata checks, size limits
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines engagement rates (70%) with brief scores (30%)
- **Deadline Monitoring**: Background task monitors approaching deadlines

### 4. Scoring Algorithm
```
Speed Score (0-30 points):
- First hour: 30 points
- Linear decay to 0 at 24 hours

Selection Score (0-70 points):
- Top 10: +30 points
- Final 3: +40 points

Total: Speed + Selection × Quality Multiplier
```

### 5. Email Notification System
- **Brief Confirmation**: Sent to users upon brief submission
- **New Brief Alerts**: Notify all miners of new opportunities
- **Deadline Reminders**: 2-hour warnings for inactive miners
- **Selection Updates**: Top 10 and final 3 notifications
- **Provider Support**: SendGrid and AWS SES backends

### 6. Storage Integration
- **R2 Client**: Complete Cloudflare R2 integration for video storage
- **Validation Pipeline**: Content type, size, and accessibility checks
- **Presigned URLs**: Temporary access for video processing

```

## 🔄 Brief Lifecycle

### 1. Brief Creation (by User)
```python
brief = Brief(
    brief_id="brief_20241204_abc123",
    user_email="user@example.com",
    title="Create a 30-second AI video about future tech",
    description="Looking for creative AI-generated video...",
    requirements="MP4 format, 1080p, 30 seconds"
)
```

### 2. Miner Submission
```bash
# Commit format: {briefId}:sub_1:{r2_link}
git commit -m "brief_20241204_abc123:sub_1:https://r2.storage/video.mp4"
```

### 3. Validator Processing
- Parses commit message
- Validates brief exists and is active
- Checks R2 video exists and is valid format
- Stores submission with validation status
- Triggers GCP processing pipeline

### 4. Scoring & Selection
- Speed score based on submission time
- User selects top 10 after 6 hours
- Selected miners can submit revisions (`sub_2`)
- Final 3 selection determines winners

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# R2 Storage
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=infinitevibe-submissions
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Email
EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid  # or aws_ses
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@infinitevibe.ai
```

## 🔄 Validator Changes

### Enhanced Submission Processing
```python
async def _refresh_peer_submissions(self, peer: PeerMetadata) -> dict:
    # Check if this is a brief submission
    if peer.brief_commit:
        return await self._process_brief_submission(peer)
    
    # Otherwise handle traditional gist submissions
    await peer.update_submissions()
    # ... existing logic
```

### Hybrid Scoring System
```python
async def calculate_and_set_weights(self) -> None:
    # Calculate traditional engagement rates
    engagement_rates = await self._calculate_miner_engagement_rates()
    
    # Calculate brief-based scores
    brief_scores = await self._calculate_brief_scores()
    
    # Combine scores (70% engagement, 30% briefs)
    for hotkey in all_hotkeys:
        combined_scores[hotkey] = (
            engagement_rates.get(hotkey, 0) * 0.7 + 
            brief_scores.get(hotkey, 0) * 0.3
        )
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Comprehensive Logging
- Brief submission processing
- R2 validation results
- Scoring calculations
- Email delivery status
- Deadline monitoring alerts

### Performance Metrics
- Submission processing time
- R2 validation success rate
- Email delivery rates
- Brief completion statistics

## 🧪 Testing

### Demo Scripts
- `demo_week1_implementation.py`: Models and parsing
- `demo_week2_implementation.py`: Complete validator integration
- `miner_submissions_report.py`: Analytics and reporting

## 🚀 Integration Points

### GCP Cloud Run (Placeholder)
```python
async def _trigger_video_processing(self, submission: BriefSubmission):
    """Trigger GCP video processing pipeline"""
    # TODO: Integrate with John's Cloud Run job
    logger.info(f"Would trigger GCP processing for {submission.submission_id}")
```

### Email Integration
- Ready for SendGrid or AWS SES
- Template-based HTML emails
- Batch processing for miner notifications

## 📈 Scoring Impact

### Example Scenarios
1. **High Engagement + Good Briefs**: 25.4% × 0.7 + 85 × 0.3 = 43.3 points
2. **No Engagement + Excellent Briefs**: 0% × 0.7 + 92 × 0.3 = 27.6 points
3. **High Engagement + No Briefs**: 25.4% × 0.7 + 0 × 0.3 = 17.8 points

This ensures miners are rewarded for both traditional engagement and brief participation.
